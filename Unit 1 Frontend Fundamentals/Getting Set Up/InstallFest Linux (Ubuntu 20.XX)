Please note, this is a compilation of resources we've picked up on over time and may not encompass everything you need to install if you are running a Linux Operating System on your computer.

Also note the entire program is taught and demonstrated using a maching running MacOSX. That said, instructors may have limited experience working with a Linux laptop.

So, please be advised there may be a diminished experience in the level of support instructors are able to offer for issues related specifically to linux.

Configuring a Global git ignore
Note: This is IMPORTANT -- Everyone should have a global git ignore file so that you don’t have to worry about making the appropriate entries in a project’s git ignore.

First, create the file: touch ~/.gitignore_global
Next, configure git to use this file: git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
Finally, lets put some good stuff in there (.gitignore_global):
A. nano ~/.gitignore_global- opens the file in the nano text editor.

B. Copy the contents from the code block below.

C. ctrl+vin nano to paste them in

D. ctrl+xwhich will prompt you to save, hit y for yes then hit enter, then enter again.

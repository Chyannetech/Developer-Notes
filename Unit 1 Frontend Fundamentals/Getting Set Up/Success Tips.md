Emotional Framing
Things will not go as you plan
Deal with chaos in your head; being confused/lost is NORMAL
No one pays you because you know all the answers
The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution
Make a friend with discomfort
The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic
This experience is a rollercoaster



The most successful students find programming fascinating; they don't think
of it as an obligation or chore

The most successful students go above and beyond; if there is
something they feel they should know, they will go and learn it

If there is a problem for which they think they need more information to solve, they go and find that information

The most successful students don't wait for instructors to hand them the answer

Successful students quickly see that programming is not about learning a recipe,

it's about developing a mindset to solve unforeseen problems

Hard Work: the equivalent of another full-time job (~40 hrs per week)

Be open and ready to receive constructive criticism

Classroom Culture
Open safe environment
Take ownership of your experience
Check your ego at the door
Empathy
Be courteous calm and patient with others; don't let the stress get to you!
Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday


Mentorship / Collaborative Culture in the Classroom
Take care of each other
Benchmarking: some are good at one thing, others at another; leverage each other's strengths
Teaching is the best way of truly solidifying your understanding of a concept
Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!


Common Student Concerns
I'm making a lot of mistakes
Mistakes are a part of life as a developer


By the end of each unit project, you should feel mostly comfortable with applying the material


There are three stages to learning something:
Imitation (follow along)
Assimilation (repetitive simple tasks: homework and labs)
Innovation (build something new on your own - project time)


Nobody knows everything, it's about how well you learn



Programming is more about thinking logically than doing equations

What's the best practice? What's the one "correct" answer?
Best practices change constantly and from company to company
If you think properly, you'll probably naturally arrive at a best practice

All that matters is "Does it work?"

Use your time to learn new technology or strengthen your problem solving

Only the people who write the specifications for the language understand everything about the language

Trust the process and know that if you practice what you learn long enough, the skills will come.
